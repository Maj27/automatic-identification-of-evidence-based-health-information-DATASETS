 Influenza (The Flu)  Influenza or 'the flu' is a highly contagious disease caused by infection from influenza type A or B (or rarely C) virus. These viruses infect the upper airways and lungs.  The flu is highly contagious and occurs year round but peaks each year from May to September.  Flu is not the same as a common cold, and can be a serious illness. For some people, such as the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions, the flu can cause serious complications which require hospitalisation. It can sometimes lead to death.  Flu is usually spread through infected people coughing and sneezing, which temporarily contaminates the surrounding air and surfaces with infected droplets. You can reduce the risk of infection by getting vaccinated and practising good hand and respiratory hygiene.  Occasionally there have been worldwide outbreaks of flu, known as flu pandemics, which have occurred with the global spread of a new type of flu virus.  Signs and Symptoms:  Symptoms usually appear 1–3 days after being infected. A person can spread flu to others 1–2 days before they become unwell and up to 5 days after symptoms develop.  The symptoms of influenza can include:  fever  dry cough  muscle and joint pain  tiredness/extreme exhaustion  headache  sore throat  stuffy nose.  Most people recover within a week, although a cough and tiredness may persist.  Treatment:  Generally, uncomplicated flu is managed by simply resting in bed, drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water) and taking over-the-counter medication to help relieve the symptoms.  Antiviral medications reduce the length of time symptoms last and help people return to their daily routines earlier. These medications are most effective if they are started within 48 hours of flu symptoms appearing.  have a cough and high fever (38 degrees Celsius or more) that is not improving.  Transmission:  The flu can spread from person to person by:  droplets spread from an infected person's coughs or sneezes (these droplets generally travel less than 1 metre)  touching surfaces contaminated by infected droplets (including hands, phones, keyboards and door handles) and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes.  Flu viruses can survive on some hard surfaces for several hours. You should regularly clean frequently touched surfaces such as door handles, taps, tables, benches and fridge doors. Flu viruses can be removed with normal household detergents.  Prevention:  Good hygiene is essential to protect yourself and others:  stay home when you are sick  wash your hands regularly with soap and water or use an alcohol based hand gel  wash your hands prior to touching your eyes, nose and mouth  use a tissue, or the inside of your arm, when you cough and sneeze  throw tissues away immediately and wash hands  don't share items such as cigarettes, cups, lipstick, toys or anything which has come into contact with the mouth or nose  stay at least 1 metre away from people who have flu-like symptoms  clean frequently touched surfaces regularly, such as door handles, taps, tables, benches and fridge doors.  Vaccination  Being vaccinated gives you protection against flu by building immunity to the virus and preventing transmission of the virus to other people.  Vaccination is required annually, as immunity from the vaccine decreases over time and the vaccine can change each year to cover the current virus strains. The best time to be vaccinated against flu is between March and May, before the flu season starts. Vaccination usually takes up to 2 weeks to be effective.  Vaccinations can be given to anyone aged 6 months or older, and is strongly recommended for people at higher risk of developing complications.  High-risk groups:  All adults aged > 65 years of age  Pregnant women during any trimester  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged > 15 years of age  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 6 months to
