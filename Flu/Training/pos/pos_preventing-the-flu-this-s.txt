 Preventing the flu this season - WPSD Local 6: Your news, weather, and sports authority  MAYFIELD, Ky - The National Influenza Vaccination week starts Monday. This comes shortly after the Center for Disease Control announced this year's vaccine may not be as effective.  The CDC said Influenza A (H3N2) has mutated so its not the exact form of flu that is in this year's flu vaccine. The CDC said this is the most common strain this year.  Graves County Health Department Registered Nurse Rita Thorn said it's not unusual for a flu strain to mutate from time to time. She said its still very important to get vaccinated.  "It will make it a little less severe than what it would be if you hadn't got the flu vaccine because that strain is still in there," Thorn said.  Flu shot or not, Thorn said one of the best ways to prevent getting the flu is to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. In addition to washing your hands, Thorn said you can use hand sanitizer if you don't have access to soap and water, sneeze into a tissue or into your sleeve, stay home from school or work if you're sick, and stay at home from shopping.  She said prevention and treating symptoms when they appear is crucial.  The CDC reports an average of 200,000 hospitalizations every year because of flu symptoms. About 23,000 people die each year because of it. Children under five and people above 65 are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated.
