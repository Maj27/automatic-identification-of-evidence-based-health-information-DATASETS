H1N1 Flu Prevention Information  You can help prevent influenza sickness for you and your family by following the everyday actions show below, and by getting both your seasonal influenza and H1N1 Flu vaccination shots.  Although the 2009-2010 seasonal flu shot is not expected to protect against the H1N1 Flu virus, a seasonal flu shot is important because it can prevent the spread of other viruses that cause respiratory infections.  The symptoms of the H1N1 Flu are similar to the symptoms of seasonal flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people have reported diarrhea and vomiting associated with H1N1 influenza. If you are sick or think you may have H1N1 influenza, please contact your healthcare provider.  Cover your cough : Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.  Wash your hands : Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.  Avoid spreading germs : Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Try to avoid close contact with anyone who is sick. Germs spread this way.  Stay home if you are sick : If you are sick with flu-like illness, CDC recommends that you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. (Your fever should be gone without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.) Keep away from others as much as possible to keep from making them sick.
