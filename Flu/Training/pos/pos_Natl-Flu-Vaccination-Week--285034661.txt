 Nat'l Flu Vaccination Week reminding people to get vaccinated  By KBJR News 1  Credit: MGN Online  Nat'l Flu Vaccination Week reminding people to get vaccinated  December 7, 2014 Updated Dec 7, 2014 at 8:31 PM CDT  Duluth, MN (NNCNOW.com) --- National Influenza Vaccination Week is coming just as fresh flu concerns are spreading… well, like the flu.  Northland public health agencies and health care organizations statewide are sponsoring influenza vaccination clinics this entire week.  The main concern over this flu season is that the current shot or nasal spray won’t be as effective in preventing the flu as once hoped.  That’s because the most common strain this season has mutated slightly from the strain used in the vaccine.  Still, health experts say the shot is effective in fighting the flu, as it also fights other, less common strains that could impact you this season.  Everyone six months and older is recommended to get vaccinated each year.
